# Midio Manifesto

## The Problem

AI tools today are either:
- **Monolithic** — one model does everything, badly
- **Pipeline-linear** — A → B → C, no feedback, no adaptation
- **Invisible** — the orchestration happens in YAML configs nobody can read

None of these match how intelligence actually works. Intelligence is a **swarm** — parallel, adaptive, self-correcting, and deeply topological.

## The Vision

Midio is a **visual canvas** where you compose AI agent swarms by dragging nodes and connecting them with yarn. It's not a workflow builder. It's a **loom**.

### What makes it different:

1. **Topology over sequence** — Connections are spatial, not just ordered. A verifier node can sit *between* two planners and interrupt either one.

2. **Agents have agency** — Nodes aren't just functions. They have state, memory, and the ability to refuse, retry, or escalate.

3. **Time is a first-class dimension** — Every canvas has a timeline. You can replay, branch, and diff any moment in the swarm's history.

4. **Molt is a feature, not a bug** — When the system needs to evolve, you don't patch. You molt. Re-evaluate, rewind, re-weave.

5. **æ guards enforce invariants** — Some things must never change. æ guard nodes are anchored across the 4D manifold, watching for drift.

## The Name

**Midio** — from "medio" (the middle), because this tool sits at the center of the swarm. The meeting point. The loom where threads cross.

## Who it's for

- People who think in graphs, not lists
- Builders who want to *see* their agent architecture
- Anyone tired of debugging invisible orchestration

## The First Step

Wire the 8 AM ritual. Prove the loom works. Then teach others by handing them a blank canvas.
